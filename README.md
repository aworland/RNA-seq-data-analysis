## RNA-seq data analysis 
This project consists of script used to analyze RNA-seq generated through different organizations and in different hosts. Data is analyzed via differential gene expression (DEG) and FPKM counts. The data was received in these formats and this code **does not** use packages such as DESeq2.

These scripts use the package KEGG from Bioservices to parse through genes associated with various KEGG pathways of interest.
